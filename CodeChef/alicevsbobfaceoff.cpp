#### Name: Alice vs Bob Faceoff 
#### Language: C++
#### Platform: Codechef
#### Question: https://www.codechef.com/LTIME100B/problems/ALBOFACE

#### Question Statement
Alice and Bob have got an integer N. They decide to play a game. Alice and Bob make alternating moves: Alice makes the first move, Bob makes the second move, 
Alice makes the third one, and so on. The game continues until N becomes 0. The player who is unable to make a move loses.
During each turn a player can make one of the following moves:
Choose an integer X such that X can be expressed as 2Y, Yâ‰¥1. The chosen X must also be a factor of N. After choosing an integer X which satisfies the mentioned criteria,
the player will divide N by X.
If Move 1 is not possible , the player will subtract 1 from N.
Predict the winner of the game if the game is played optimally by both the players.
