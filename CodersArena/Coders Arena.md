# Inspiration behind creating the logo

I really love creating logos. When I saw the issue regarding *help for logo designing* I knew that I could be of some help to this wonderful community of Sarthak Keshari. So I designed this logo which looks like a cubical arena which symbolizes a place where like minded coders can help each other out. I'm really happy that I get to be a part of this amazing community!
