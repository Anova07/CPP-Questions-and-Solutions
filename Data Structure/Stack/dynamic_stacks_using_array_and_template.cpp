/* EXPLANATION OF DYNAMIC STACK ALONG WITH CODE*/
/*
Stacks, often known as Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structures, are well-known.
Push and pop are the two primary operations of a stack, where push puts an element at the top and pop removes an element from the top.

Whenever a stack implementation is considered, the size is now pre-determined or fixed. Even though it is dynamically allocated, its size cannot be altered after it is created.
As a result, a situation known as "stack full" develops.

therefore to overcome this situation a concept was introduced call dynamic stack.

The concept of a "dynamicÂ stack" is to allocate extra memory so that the "stack full" scenario does not occur.
By allocating fresh memory that is bigger than the previous stack memory and transferring components from the old stack to the new stack and Finally, rename the new stack to 
the old stack's name.

/*
At first we create a class named StackUsingArray along with a template so that we dont have to repeat the same code for different data types.
inside the class we declare three variables.
1. *data (for dynamically creating the array which we will use as stack.)
2. nextIndex (stores the current index position of the stack.)
3. capacity (stores the total size of the stack.)
*/

/*
A no argument constructor is created and the variables are initialized.
NOTE:the pointer variable- data is used to dynamically create the array which is initialised to 4 along with nextIndex=0 and capacity=4.
  
Why we intialized the size of data to 4 and capacity to 4?
reason:dynamic stack uses the concept that when the array gets full then a new array is created of size double then the previous one so intially we assumed that the size 
and capacity to be 4

/*
function push inserts the values in the stack.In this function the main stuff happens-
  
lets assume for now that we have a stack of size 4 and is currently full and data is the pointer for the array.
 
data->array1:  10,20,30,40
       Index:   0, 1, 2, 3
 
so right now the NextIndex value is 4 and capacity is 4 so no more elements can be added.
Now create a new stack of size double than old stack and copy all elements from old stack and then push the new element to the new stack.We create the new stack dynamically 
using pointer variable named Newdata.

array2:  10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0   [note:i am assuming 0's to be the garbage values]
Index: 0  , 1  , 2  , 3  , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7
  
after that we deallocate the data and point the data to the  address where the Newdata is pointing
This is how we create a stack with full freedom of size.
